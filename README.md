Thanks to @Suman kalyan chowdary Kadiyala. 

The difference between his code and this repo is that, This code works with Code generated from Swaggers that contain API's in separate files. e.g. ACLsAPI.java, AdminAPI.java, UsersAPI.java. However, For the other repo all API methods are in DefaultAPI.java. 

Tested
1. User Login - POST
2. User Update - PUT
3. User Delete - DELETE
3. Photo Upload - Multipart Form data upload
4. Updated dependencies
